    <p>When I first entered the fence of Thammasat University, I was full of excitement and nervousness. I had to adapt to new environments, study more difficult subjects such as math, and participate in club activities. I learned time management and working with new friends, which was a challenging but fun experience at the same time.</p>
    <h2>Discover new interests and skills</h2>
    <p><li>Second year of study I intend to study AI and research about AI on my own, so I have to concentrate on collecting points so that I can have the opportunity to participate in an internship at a company that allows me to learn real work, do my own small projects, and receive guidance from experienced teammates. I feel like I'm starting to have more direction in my career path.</li></p>
    <h2>Project development and teamwork</h2>
    <p><li>Third year I hope to get an internship at a company that involves work that requires both programming and data analysis skills. Working with my teammates has allowed me to learn teamwork and managing problems together. This will be an experience that teaches me how to be flexible and adaptable so that everyone on the team can work together effectively.</li></p>
    <h2>Preparing for the future</h2>
    <p><li>Final year of study I have completed an internship trial in a small company. moreover I also prepared myself for applying for a job at the tech company I dreamed of. Preparing for interviews, practicing for coding tests, and learning new skills can be tiring, but full of commitment and hope for the future to come.</li></p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><li><emoji text>In these 4 years, I will try to do my best on the path I have drawn. Don't worry because I always have a backup plan.üòè</emoji></li></p>
