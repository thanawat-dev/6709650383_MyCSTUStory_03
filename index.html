        <p class="par1"><li>Greeting! Let me introduce myself My name Thanawat Kulapun 
          Nickname Makarov or Mark as you like Iâ€™m 18 years old. Iâ€™m from Thailand so itâ€™s mean that Iâ€™m Thai. My birthday is the 8th of May 2006. Iâ€™m a student at Suankularbwittayalai Rangsit School. My school is in Pathum Thani. My favorite color is Red ,Orange and Yellow (because I love hot color tone) I want to visit Germany, Japan and China.</li></p>
        <p class="par2"><li>My favorite food is Pizza and Japanese curry. My favorite fruit is Apple, Banana and Pineapple. but I like all delicious food I eat 
          what I have But I want to try a Baguette of France sometime it must be really tasty Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s solid.</li></p>
        <p class="par3"><li>I used to study at Sarasas Witaed Klongluang when I was in childhood all the way long for 9 years at the same place. I see a lots of Change during 9 years such as more and bigger canteen, Music room that never has before, more school building, football field, child playground and much more I canâ€™t tell you all. My school life is great I got a 4.00 grade all the years and 1st place in the class. This school has no beautiful place or landmark but a fountain, but not much to remember because the school fuse was completed so Iâ€™m a OSWK 9.</li></p>
        <p class="par4"><li>I think my special ability is memorization, I have a good memory from childhood while I was study at my old school, Sarasas Witaed Klongluang when teacher taught me something, I remembered it all. That why I got first place in the class so I think it must be my special but then when I start my M.1 class at Suankularb Wittayalai Rangsit School I almost failed my Final exam and almost in the last of the class so I start to think that Is my memorization my special ability?</li></p>
        <p class="par5"><li>In my holiday, I went to Krungthep with my family. I went to Krungthep by car. It took about 3 hours. After that my family ate noodles. Next my family went to temple. After that my family went to visit my grandfather. Next My family went to a restaurants with my grandfather. My family ate Noodle with my grandfather. My family took my grandfather to his house. After that my family went home. I was very happy an I had a lot of fun.</li></p>
